# tsp_optimization
This project contains several common optimization methods to cope with traveling salesman problem.

These methods includes:
1. hill climbing
2. random walk
3. simulated annealing
4. tabu search
5. Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
6. Genetic Algorithm(GA)
7. Ant Colony System
8. Hybrid Algorithm(PSO+TS)

*All methods can be referenced in the methods.py file. \n
*Example dataset 'Distance.csv'  records the distance of 7-11 stores in Nangang, Taipei.\n
*Run main_tsp.py for experiment results\n
*Plot the results with plot_results.ipynb file\n
