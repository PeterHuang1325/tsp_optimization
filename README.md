# TSP_Optimization
This project implements traveling salesman problem with several common optimization methods.

These methods includes:
1. Hill Climbing
2. Random Walk
3. Simulated Annealing
4. Tabu Search
5. Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
6. Genetic Algorithm(GA)
7. Ant Colony System
8. Hybrid Algorithm(PSO+TS)

# Hints
*All methods can be referenced in the 'methods.py' file.  
*Example dataset 'Distance.csv'  records the distance of 7-11 stores in Nangang, Taipei.  
*Run 'main_tsp.py' for experiment results.  
*Plot the results with 'plot_results.ipynb' file.
