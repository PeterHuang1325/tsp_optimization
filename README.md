# TSP_Optimization
This project implements traveling salesman problem on 7-11 stores in Nangang, Taipei with famous **heuristic optimization** methods.

These methods includes:
1. Hill Climbing
2. Random Walk
3. Simulated Annealing
4. Tabu Search
5. Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
6. Genetic Algorithm(GA)
7. Ant Colony System
8. Hybrid Algorithm(PSO+TS)

# Hints
*All methods can be referenced in the 'methods.py' file.  
*Example dataset 'Distance.csv'  records the distance of 7-11 stores in Nangang, Taipei.  
*Run 'main_tsp.py' for experiment results.  
*Plot the results with 'plot_result.ipynb' file.

# Results
1. Figure 1 denotes the distance result across iterations for all methods. <img src=/images/compare.png width=80% height=80%>
2. Figure 2 denotes the pin point of 7-11 stores on Google map for `PSO+TS` method. <img src=/images/pso_tb.png width=80% height=80%>
